This project is a versatile QR Code generation system that allows users to create QR codes based on the provided links.

Furthermore, the generated QR Code is automatically sent to the user's email.

The project makes use of external libraries: javax.mail (library to facilitate sending emails efficiently) and zxing (Library for generating QR codes, providing a solid implementation).

Unit tests were also implemented with JUnit to guarantee the integrity of the system, ensuring consistent operation in different scenarios
